# Fox Classifier
1. To run the classifier, have installed Python 3.6 and download the fox.py file as well as the fox16.xml located in the haar_cascades/fox_classifiers/ filepath.
2. Then put both files in the same directory with fox.py in the root and fox16.xml in haar_cascades/fox_classifiers/.
3. Run the fox.py program and the program should open up the local webcam connected to your computer!
4. Recognize foxes!(hopefully)
